                <p>(Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages,
                    but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is
                    with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the
                    language.
                    As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
    
                    A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — <span class="emp">HTML is the most common markup language</span>, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
    
                    Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.
